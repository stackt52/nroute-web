# Schema

All complex object schemas that are used in the app should be defined here and exported for ease reference. We are 
using [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) as a schema builder.

> Yup is a schema builder for runtime value parsing and validation. Define a schema, transform a value to match, assert the shape of an existing value, or both. Yup schema are extremely expressive and allow modeling complex, interdependent validations, or value transformation.
